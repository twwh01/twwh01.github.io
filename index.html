<p>Welcome to my personal GitHub site: a motley collection professional information and personal ramblings. </p>
<p>I have built this site primarily to see if I can (learning GitHub, html, and css seemed like as good a thing as any to do in 2020/21...). 
I hope to expand into other coding languages and will try to incorporate some of my thoughts on those here as well.</p>
